=== Projects
'''
==== *Parking lot control system:*
Project link: https://github.com/mzhirko/convenient-parking[https://github.com/mzhirko/convenient-parking]:::
An application for recognizing free parking spaces using M-RCNN. The user provides photo or video data to process and find free parking spaces on it. Containerized in Docker. +
Programming language: Python; +
Tools: Docker, Keras, Tensorflow v.1, OpenCV.

==== *Image compression tool:* 
Project link: https://github.com/mzhirko/image-compressor[https://github.com/mzhirko/image-compressor]:::
An application for compressing images using the conception of recirculation neural network with adaptive learning step and normalization of weights. +
Programming language: Python; +
Tools: matplotlib, numpy.


==== *Sequence prediction tool:* 
Project link: https://github.com/mzhirko/sequence-prediction[https://github.com/mzhirko/sequence-prediction]:::
Implementation of an Elman network model with a linear activation function. +
Programming language: Python; +
